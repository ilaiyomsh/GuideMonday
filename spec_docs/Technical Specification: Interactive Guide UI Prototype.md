Technical Specification: Interactive Guide UI PrototypeVersion: 1.0Date: September 28, 2025Author: Ilai. OverviewThis document provides a comprehensive technical breakdown of the "GuideMonday" UI prototype. The prototype is a single-file HTML document designed to simulate a dynamic, interactive guide and content management system. Its primary purpose is to serve as a high-fidelity, interactive mockup for stakeholder review and as a blueprint for the final implementation in a production framework like React.The design is heavily inspired by and aligned with the monday.com Vibe Design System, emphasizing a clean, intuitive, and component-driven user experience. All interactivity is handled via vanilla JavaScript, and the state is managed through CSS classes to maintain simplicity and focus on the UI/UX patterns.2. Architectural Principles2.1. Core LayoutThe application employs a standard two-column layout:A fixed-width Sidebar (.sidebar) on the right for global navigation.A flexible Main Content area (.main-content) on the left that serves as a container for rendering different views or "pages".This structure is achieved using CSS Flexbox on the main .App container.2.2. State Management via CSSFor the purpose of this prototype, application state (e.g., current view, edit mode status, accordion expansion) is managed declaratively using a system of CSS classes applied to container elements. A global .edit-mode-active class on the root .App element, for example, conditionally reveals all editing controls throughout the interface. This approach avoids complex JavaScript state management and cleanly separates logic from presentation.2.3. Component-Oriented StructureWhile contained in a single HTML file, the DOM is structured logically to mimic a component-based architecture. Elements are grouped into reusable patterns like .chapter-card, .content-block, and .page-header, making the code readable and easily translatable to a framework like React.2.4. Styling and ThemingThe visual design adheres to the Vibe Design System principles. This is implemented through:CSS Custom Properties (Variables): A :root declaration holds global design tokens for colors, fonts, spacing, and border-radius. This allows for easy theming and ensures consistency.BEM-like Naming Convention: A loose BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology is used for CSS classes (e.g., .content-block, .block-controls, .nav-link.active) to create predictable, conflict-free styles.3. Component & Functionality Breakdown3.1. Sidebar (.sidebar)The sidebar is the primary navigation element.Structure: Contains a header, a main navigation list, and a conditional "Add Chapter" button.Navigation (nav):Home Link: A standard link that navigates to the Home Page view.Chapter Items (.chapter-item): These are compound components with dual functionality:Title (.chapter-title-link): Clicking the chapter's name acts as a .nav-link to switch the main content view to that specific chapter.Accordion Toggle (.chapter-accordion-toggle): Clicking the chevron icon expands or collapses the list of sections within that chapter without changing the current page. This allows users to browse the guide's structure without losing their place.Edit Mode Functionality:+ Add Chapter Button (.add-item-button): This button is positioned at the bottom of the sidebar. It is only visible when .edit-mode-active is applied to the .App container. Its function is to initiate the process of creating a new chapter.3.2. Main Content & Page ViewsThe .main-content element functions as a router outlet, displaying one of two page views at a time.3.2.1. Home Page (#home-page)Purpose: Serves as the application's landing page, providing an overview of the available chapters.Layout: A responsive grid (.chapter-grid) of .chapter-card components.Chapter Card (.chapter-card): A clickable element that displays a chapter's title and description. It functions as a .nav-link, navigating the user to the corresponding #chapter-page on click.3.2.2. Chapter Page (#chapter-page)Purpose: Displays the detailed content of a single chapter, organized into collapsible sections.Header (.page-header): Displays the chapter title and contains the main Edit Mode toggle switch for the current view.Sections (.section): Each chapter is composed of one or more sections, implemented as accordions.Accordion Toggle (.section-accordion-toggle): The section title, which expands/collapses the section's content blocks.Content Blocks (.content-block): The atomic unit of content within a section. Each block has a base style and is further defined by a modifier class (e.g., .block-text, .block-image). This modularity allows for a flexible content structure.Edit Mode Functionality:Block Controls (.block-controls): A contextual toolbar that appears on hover over a .content-block only when in edit mode. It provides controls for re-ordering (move up/down) and deleting the block.Add Block Controls (.add-controls-container): A toolbar that appears at the end of each section's content in edit mode. It contains icon-based buttons for adding new content blocks of various types (Text, Image, Video, GIF, Link).+ Add Section Button (.add-item-button): Appears at the bottom of the chapter page in edit mode, allowing for the creation of new sections within the chapter.4. Interactivity (JavaScript Implementation)All interactivity is managed by a single script block that runs on the DOMContentLoaded event. Event delegation is used extensively on the .App container to optimize performance.Edit Mode Logic:The two Edit Mode toggles (on the Home and Chapter pages) are synchronized. Changing one updates the other.The toggle's change event listener adds or removes the .edit-mode-active class from the root .App element. This single class change triggers all conditional UI visibility via CSS, ensuring a clean and efficient state transition.Page Navigation Logic:A click listener on .nav-link elements prevents the default anchor behavior.It retrieves the target page ID from the data-page attribute.It then iterates through all .page-view elements, toggling the .hidden class to display the target page and hide the others.Finally, it manages the .active class on navigation links to provide visual feedback.Accordion Logic:A single, delegated click listener handles both sidebar and section accordions.It identifies the clicked toggle (.chapter-accordion-toggle or .section-accordion-toggle).It finds the adjacent .accordion-content element.It toggles the .active class on the button (for styling, e.g., rotating the icon) and the .open class on the content pane. The smooth expand/collapse animation is handled purely by CSS transitions on the max-height property.5. Next Steps & Production ConsiderationsThis prototype successfully validates the core UI/UX patterns. For a production-ready application, the following steps are recommended:Framework Migration: Deconstruct the HTML into a component hierarchy using a framework like React. Each logical block (e.g., Sidebar, ChapterCard, ContentBlock) should become a reusable component.State Management: Replace the CSS class-based state with a formal state management solution (e.g., React Context, Zustand, Redux) to handle the guide's data structure, edit mode status, and active UI elements.API Integration: The static content should be replaced with data fetched from a backend API. The application state will be populated and updated via API calls.Rich Text Editing: For creating and editing text blocks, implement a rich text editor library (e.g., TipTap, Slate.js) to provide users with formatting capabilities.
